**Objective:** Confront the final challenge and escape.

- **The Final Memory:** The players arrive at the "Core Memory," a grand hall filled with mirrors. In each mirror, they see different versions of [[Ateos]]—young, old, triumphant, and defeated. This represents the core of [[Ateos]]’s identity, the place where all his memories converge.
    
- **Boss Encounter:** The final obstacle is a fragmented version of [[Ateos]], a manifestation of his doubts and fears. This could be a combat encounter or a test of will where the players must convince [[Ateos]] to awaken by helping him reconcile with his past.
    
- **Escape:** Once the boss is defeated or pacified, the mindscape begins to collapse. The players must race against time to reach the "Exit Point," using the Mind Anchor to pull themselves back to reality. They might face one last challenge—a puzzle or a skill check—to escape as the mindscape crumbles around them.
