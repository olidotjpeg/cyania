**Objective:** Enter the wizard’s mind and understand the situation.

- **Hook:** The players are hired by a powerful mage's guild to awaken [[Ateos]], who has been in a trance for centuries. The guild suspects that something has gone wrong, and they need adventurers to enter his mind and figure out what's keeping him in this state.
    
- **Entering the Mind:** The party is given a magical artifact, the "Mind Anchor," which allows them to project themselves into [[Ateos]]'s mind. Upon activating the artifact, they find themselves in a vast, endless library with books floating in mid-air, stairs leading nowhere, and doors that open to different memories.
    
- **First Encounter:** The players encounter a fragment of [[Ateos]]’s mind—a version of the mage from his youth. This fragment is frantic, trying to organize the chaos of the mindscape. He explains that the mind has become a labyrinth, filled with dangers, and that they must reach the "Core Memory" to escape.
