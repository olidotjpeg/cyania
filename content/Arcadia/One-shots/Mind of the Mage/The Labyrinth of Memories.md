**Objective:** Navigate through the shifting memories and solve puzzles to proceed.

- **Memory Corridors:** The party must travel through corridors lined with doors, each leading to a significant memory. Each memory is a puzzle or a combat encounter representing different aspects of [[Ateos]]’s life:
    
    1. **Memory of Creation:** The players find themselves in a workshop where [[Ateos]] is crafting a powerful magical item. The puzzle here involves helping [[Ateos]] complete the item by solving a riddle related to the properties of different magical materials.
        
    2. **Memory of Fear:** The players are transported to a battlefield where a young [[Ateos]] faced his greatest fear—a powerful dragon. They must either defeat the dragon or find a way to quell [[Ateos]]’s fear, perhaps by uncovering a hidden truth in the memory.
        
    3. **Memory of Loss:** The players witness a tragic event—a loved one of [[Ateos]]'s dying. Here, they must solve a puzzle that symbolizes letting go, such as arranging items that represent different stages of grief.
        
- **Mindscape Hazards:** As they navigate these memories, the mindscape itself begins to react to the players' presence. Shifting corridors, sudden gravity changes, and reality-warping effects force them to stay alert.
