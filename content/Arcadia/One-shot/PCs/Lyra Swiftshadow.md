The flicker of the torchlight dances across Lyra Swiftshadow's rune-studded leather armor, each rune shimmering with different hues. In their left hand, she deftly fingers a set of dragon dice, made from the rarest of dragon scales. In their right hand, they twirl razor-sharp sword, the blade reflecting a cold, but deadly gleam. Their eyes, just under the hood scans the surroundings, with the calculated precision of a predator. A killer? Perhaps. A thief? Most certainly.
