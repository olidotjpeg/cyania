Let's create an artifact that fits the theme.

**Introducing: "Echokeeper"**

The Echokeeper is an advanced, sentient mechanical device imbued with magical energy. This ancient technology is said to contain residual memories and knowledge from the creators who forged the earliest magical constructs in Cyania's history.

**Properties of the Echokeeper:**

1. **Magical Core**: The Echokeeper's core contains a concentrated reservoir of magical energy, allowing it to enhance or amplify spellcasting effects.
2. **Memory Storage**: The device stores memories and knowledge from its creators, making it a valuable resource for understanding ancient magical constructs and their weaknesses.
3. **Automated Analysis**: The Echokeeper can analyze magical patterns and predict potential outcomes of various spell combinations, making it an invaluable tool for spellcasters.

**Importance in Cyania:**

As the world prepares for war against magical constructs, the Echokeeper holds significant strategic value:

1. **Advantage for Magical Forces**: Possession of the Echokeeper grants its wielder unparalleled insight into construct weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
2. **Disadvantage for Construct-Controlling Forces**: The Arcadian Council or other factions seeking to exploit magical constructs will stop at nothing to acquire the Echokeeper, as it could reveal their plans.

**Rationale for Framing the Adventurers:**

The framing incident is orchestrated by a faction within the Arcadian Council (or an external adversary) who seek to:

1. **Mislead Authorities**: Create a false narrative about the adventurers stealing the Echokeeper to conceal their own intentions.
2. **Gain Advantage**: Use the theft as a pretext for stricter control over magical constructs, solidifying their grip on Cyania's government and infrastructure.

**A C T 2 Adjustments:**

With the Echokeeper as the artifact of interest, A C T 2 can focus on:

1. **Gathering Information**: Adventurers will need to interview witnesses, interrogate suspects, or decipher clues related to the Echokeeper's whereabouts.
2. **Navigating World Politics**: As they delve deeper into the mystery, they'll encounter influential figures vying for control over magical constructs and the knowledge contained within the Echokeeper.

**A C T 3 Adjustments:**

In A C T 3, the final confrontation can focus on:

1. **Stopping the True Thieves**: Uncover and apprehend the masterminds behind the framing incident and the theft of the Echokeeper.
2. **Confronting the Mastermind**: The true leader of the faction responsible for the theft may be a powerful individual or a mysterious figure with ties to the creation of magical constructs.

The Echokeeper's significance adds an intriguing layer to your one-shot, allowing you to explore themes such as:

- The consequences of advanced technology in a world where magic is prevalent
- The struggle for control over powerful artifacts and knowledge
- The blurred lines between friend and foe in a world on the brink of war
