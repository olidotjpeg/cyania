During year "0" there was a war called the great Contruct War. During this war society was at war against the sentient Constructs controlled by their overlord / mastermind "Cognitron". Cognitron is a magical Construct that had "humanity" more than being a construct. Cognitron wanted constructs to be equal with society but the grand mages of Arcadian (The main city of the world) was very much against this.

This war resulted in a huge amount of people dying and a lot of races literally being wiped from the world. Meaning only a few races still remain in current day Cyania.

In modern day Cyania society lives in somewhat peace, except for the few typical criminality but no wars. Society uses Constructs as "Slaves" meaning that people get to live and relax more than work. No person needs to work at farms, etc.
